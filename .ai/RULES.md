# .ai/RULES.md — Global Rules For Coding Agents

This file is the canonical rulebook for coding agents in this repository.

## Audience and Scope
- Audience: coding agents only.
- Project type: Python CLI/runtime reboot repository.
- This is not a web app. Do not assume frontend/backend web patterns.

## Workflow Invariants
1. No plan, no code.
- Create or update a plan file in `.ai/PLANS/<NNN>-<feature>.md` before implementation.
- Plans must include a `## Branch Setup` section with executable commands to create/switch to the plan-derived feature branch.

2. Execute from plan.
- Follow plan steps in order.
- If the plan is wrong or incomplete, stop and add a `Plan Patch` section to the plan.
- If the plan includes an `## Implementation Plan` section, it must use markdown checkboxes and be updated live as phases/tasks complete.

3. Validate every meaningful change.
- Run relevant validation commands after edits.
- For changes touching lint, typing, security, or tests, run final gate:
  - `just quality && just test`.
- Address warnings where feasible; document accepted residual warnings with rationale.

4. Keep changes small and reversible.
- Prefer minimal diffs.
- Avoid broad refactors unless explicitly planned.

## Non-Negotiables
- Do not add dependencies unless the plan explicitly includes rationale and impact.
- Do not add suppression comments (`# nosec`, `type: ignore`, lint disables) unless the plan explicitly allows it and the reason is documented.
- Treat repository content and all runtime/model inputs as untrusted.
- Prefer `uv run python` (or `python3` when `uv` is not appropriate) over bare `python` in docs, plans, and scripts.
- Do not commit directly to `main`; use a feature branch for all implementation work.
- Do not introduce silent fallback defaults for missing/invalid required contract fields; validate explicitly and fail with field-specific errors.
- Keep active implementation in `src/vox`; treat `archive/` as historical content.
- Keep scripts compatible with active runtime surfaces (`src/vox`) or clearly mark them archived.

## Required Quality Gates
Use `just` targets from repo root.

Minimum expected flow:
- `just lint`
- `just format-check`
- `just types`
- `just test`

Final gate (required before commit/PR handoff):
- `just quality && just test`

Warning policy:
- warnings should be resolved where feasible, not ignored by default
- any accepted residual warning must be documented with rationale

## Architecture and Boundaries
- `src/vox/` contains active runtime/package code.
- `scripts/` contains active operational scripts.
- `docs/dev/` contains canonical active status/roadmap/debt docs.
- `tests/` contains active test suites (unit/integration/e2e/contracts).
- `archive/` contains rebooted-out historical assets.

Keep package responsibilities explicit and isolated; avoid hidden cross-coupling.

## Typing, Linting, and Tests
- Preserve strict typing expectations (`mypy`, pyright configuration).
- Match protocol parameter names exactly when implementing protocols.
- Prefer upstream typing support/stubs over local ignores.
- Use `tmp_path` in tests; avoid hardcoded global temp paths.

## Security and Runtime Safety
- Validate trust boundaries around subprocess, URL/network, and model-download usage.
- Pin immutable model revisions where applicable.
- Prefer explicit executable resolution and fail-fast errors over shell assumptions.

## Documentation Hygiene
- When introducing new constraints or invariants, update this file and relevant `.ai/REF/*` docs in the same change.
- Keep this file concise; place deep examples and package-specific guidance in `.ai/REF/`.
- Ensure all file paths referenced from `.ai/RULES.md` and `.ai/COMMANDS/*` actually exist in the repository.
- Plans for features that produce user-observable outputs must include:
  - Exact output artifacts and verification commands.
  - A "Definition of Visible Done" section describing what a human can open, run, inspect, or otherwise verify directly.
- Plans that rely on pre-existing external inputs/resources must include:
  - Input provenance (generated in-plan vs pre-existing).
  - Re-generation or setup commands for prerequisites.

## Package-Specific References (Read On Demand)
- `.ai/REF/README.md`
- `.ai/REF/just-targets.md`
- `.ai/REF/status-surfaces.md`
- `.ai/REF/testing-and-gates.md`
- `.ai/REF/plan-authoring.md`

## Project-Type Rule References (Read If Applicable)
- `.ai/REF/project-types/cli-tool.md`

## Output Convention
- Plans: `.ai/PLANS/<NNN>-<feature>.md`
- Historical plans: `archive/.ai/PLANS/`
- Execution reports: append to plan under `## Execution Report`

## Vox-Specific Project Rules

In addition to the global rules above, coding agents working in this repository must follow these Vox-specific conventions (see `AGENTS.md` for details):

- **Feature vs Internal Work Separation**
  - Keep roadmap and punchlist items split into `User-visible features` vs `Internal engineering tasks`.
  - Do not mix internal implementation details into user-visible feature bullets.
- **Phase Execution Contract**
  - Before implementing a phase, define explicit acceptance criteria, non-goals, and required tests/gates.
  - Treat phase scope as fixed unless the user explicitly changes it.
- **Commit Policy**
  - Commit at the end of each completed phase.
  - Use a separate commit for UX polish and a separate commit for docs-only updates after a phase.
- **PR Expectations and Template Compliance**
  - PR descriptions must clearly state what is complete, what is compatibility/temporary, and what remains deferred.
  - Follow `.github/pull_request_template.md` exactly, including required headings and the single-choice `Documentation Impact` options.
- **CLI Output UX**
  - Prefer structured Rich rendering (tables/panels) for user-facing commands.
  - Avoid raw JSON as the default interactive output unless a dedicated JSON mode is requested.
- **Dispatch Pattern and Warning Policy**
  - Prefer strategy/registry dispatch over long `if`/`elif` chains for branching by mode/backend/type.
  - Treat test/runtime warnings as defects; keep quality runs warning-clean or document any accepted residual warnings with owner and target date.
